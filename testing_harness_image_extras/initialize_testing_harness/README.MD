The initialize_testing_harness.sh script is used on the testing harness to set up USB gadget emulation, GPIO pins and system so it's ready to run AFT. The stop_libcomposite.sh script is used to stop the emulation. Script files should be placed to /usr/bin/. The service file should be placed to /etc/systemd/system/ and to enable it make a symlink to it in /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/.
